# Terraform Setup for Kubernetes Homelab (Proxmox)

## Create cloud-init template

Instructions on creating a template can be found in the documentation located [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Telmate/proxmox/latest/docs/guides/cloud-init%2520getting%2520started#creating-a-cloud-init-template).

# Generate SSH key for Proxmox

On your local machine create the private / public key for SSH
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_proxmox -N ""
```

>[!NOTE]
>
> Upon completion of creating the VMs I found that i needed to manually connect to the server as I had some issues with ansible.
>

```
ssh root@ip.address
```
Connect with 
>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Creating a snippet is very important in this step as the template will not work with out having `qemu-guest-agent`

# Configure Variables

1. Create file `terraform.tfvars`

```
proxmox_password    = "password
proxmox_node        = "yourNode"
cloud_init_password = "initPassword"
vm_name = ["k3s-master", "k3s-worker-1", "k3s-worker-2"]
vm_template = "ubuntu-template"
cpu_cores = 1
ram_size = 2048
disk_size = "25G"
ip_addresses = ["192.x.x.x", "192.x.x.x", "192.x.x.x"]
gateway = "192.x.x.x"
```

# Initialize, Plan and Apply



1. `terraform init`:
- Initializes terraform. As this is utilizing the provider `telmate/proxmox` it will begin downloading

2. `terraform plan`:
- This shows what actions terraform will apply before actually actioning.

3. `terraform apply`:
- This will require user interaction to run. If you want to auto confirm you can with the argument `-auto-approve`.


## Additional Terraform Commands
1. `terraform fmt`:
- Formats code for readability and consistency

2. `terraform verify`:
- Checks the syntax and consistency of configuration

3. `terraform destroy`:
- This will delete the infrastructure on proxmox.

4. `terraform output`:
- This will display the data outlines in the `outputs.tf` after VM creation.
